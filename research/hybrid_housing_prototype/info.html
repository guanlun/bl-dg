Yona Friedman (born in 1923) developed his concept of Ville Spatiale, the Spatial City, on the basis of two elementary thoughts: Architecture should only provide a framework, in which the inhabitants might construct their homes according to their needs and ideas, free from any paternalism by a master builder. Furthermore, he was convinced that the progressing automation of production and, resulting from that, the increasing amount of leisure time would fundamentally change society. The traditional structure of the city, according to Friedman, is not equipped for the new society. He suggested mobile, temporary and lightweight structures instead of the rigid, inflexible and expensive means of traditional architecture.
<br/><br/>Based on such provocative and ambitious agendas from the past and armed with contemporary digital tools, it is our goal to propose a socially responsible and financially viable yet architecturally rich solution to housing the increasing population in many urban areas in the world. Particularly in China, where the need for housing has exploded in the last decade, it is time for a generation of architects to devote great efforts to such agendas and indirectly practice the ever-clearer social role of architecture through design and build activities.
