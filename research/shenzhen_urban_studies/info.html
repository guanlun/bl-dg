Sandwiched by natural hills to the north and waters of the shenzhen river and bay to the south, shenzhen develops along a clear east-west linear axis. Initially a border town that gained its momentum from being the giant backdoor factories for Hong Kong, the city gradually expanded towards the west as capital and human resources amassed. 

Shenzhen's demographics is one of the most unique and interesting cases among all Chinese cities. Vibrant, young, and eager for fortune and success, its very people is the No.1 driving force behind its economical miracle. However, as more and more people flock to town for opportunities, how to provide housing for everyone has become an increasingly criitical issue.

In the 12th five-year plan of the central Chinese government, Shenzhen has a target to build 240,000 units of affordable housing by 2015. Then densest areas of Shenzhen are Luohu, Futian, and Nanshan.Since the available plots in central ares of the 3 most prominent districts are very scarce. The current situation is that most of the plots for affordable housing are allocated far from the central areas, which means also farther from the concentration of employment possibilities.
