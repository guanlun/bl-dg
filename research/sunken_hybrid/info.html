The plot has been left undeveloped for several years, with a planned high-rise project infinitely on hold. This proposal intends to extrapolate the lessons learned from the prototypical studies of flexible systems and apply it in a scheme that manifests openness with density and adaptation. <br/><br/>Rather than extruding high into the sky, the massing is sunken into the ground. The actual structure occupies the space underneath the four streets and leave the entire footprint open for public use. The dimensions are specifically designed so that the added area of the four wings compensate for the loss of the central volume. Not only is there no sacrifice on the FAR, the sunken mass also creates a green public plaza that directly links to the Science Museum station on the Metro line 1. In addition, the underground mass allows an introverted facade that can be as freely designed and changed as one wish.<br/><br/> 
The open plaza offers plenty of room for the structure to extend and adapt to future uses. Foundations of column cores on certain locations will have been laid so that future changes can be easily accommodated.
