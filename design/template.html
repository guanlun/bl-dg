                        Danaus is an installation that explores the classic relationship between form and function through a series of multifaceted transitions of complexity, density, and depth.<br />
                        Inspired by the work of French artist George Rousse, the design firstly features a red cube made out of thin fragmented pieces in the shape of a hexagon. After entering Richardson Memorial Hall, one is confronted with the complete perspective of the cube right at the door. As one steps in and walks up the stairs in the lobby, the perfect cube reveals itself in the fragmented composition and begins a morphological process towards the floor above. Starting from small 4-sided polygons on the cube, the voids gradually morph into 5 and 6-sided shapes, simultaneously growing in size while diminishing in spacing.  The designers digitally scripted this reciprocal relationship between size and spacing to formulate another level of transition in the visual, namely from the subtractive to the additive, and further articulated it to allow Danaus a function that emerges out of its own form.<br />
                        One finally arrives at the end of Danaus and realizes its programmatic use as shelves for school publications, pamphlets, and postcards, which formerly were left flat on the bench by the administrative office. These unique shelves vary widely in size and depth to accommodate different publications and reach 11” at the deepest. The very last one of them is articulated to be a perfect hexagon, referring back to the original cube and completing the morphological cycle. <br />
                        Danaus was made out of CNC milled foam panels and achieved its challenging range of depth (1/4” to 11”) through layering and stacking. The project was awarded a Dean’s Grant from Newcomb-Tulane College and received support from the Graduate Student Government at TSA. The official opening of Danaus was held on April 28, 2011 and the installation is on view throughout the summer at the Richardson Memorial Hall at Tulane University.<br />
