The project is sited next to the levee wall and railway tracks in the Bywater neighborhood of New Orleans. Originally filled with industrious warehouses and factories, this up-and-coming neighborhood is becoming increasingly popular among artists and hipsters while still maintaining the rough industrial feeling. The design of the Warhol Foundation Office very much respects the site and intends to echo the overal rough atmosphere of the neighborhood while promoting high art in the area. Deeply rooted in Warhol's own legacy - connecting high and low culture - the design aims to create a landmark that gives back to the city.<br /> <br /> The existing sloped site is manipulated and landscaped to become an undulating surface of green space, accessible to the public. Tucked underneath this surface is an array of programs of a public nature: gallery, restaurant, cafe, and parking. Together these two levels extend the function of a planned park nearby and offers a direct connection between the private office and the general public through additional outdoor programs such as an observation deck, a picnic forest, and an amphitheatre.<br /> <br /> The sculpted green roof also influences the building mass atop where the form appears to be tilting as the ground plane is lifted up on one side. The leaning facades that face the neighborhood are covered with a sophisticated kinetic system of 6" diameter aluminum rings. This matrix of rings, individually controlled by a rotary actuator, spin with the winds during the day and creates art imagery at night. The scale of the system transforms the generic perception of off-the-shelf aluminum rings and restates Warhol's mission to connect high and low culture in an architectural way to the neighborhood and the city.
