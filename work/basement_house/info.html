When BL-DG was approached by the client, the project was already under construction: Next to the single-story 100 m2 vacation home, a 50-square-meter hole was being excavated. One thing was clear, in adding another 100 m2 to the house  and abiding by the zoning regulations, a basement had to be introduced.<br/><br/>  Rather than dismissing the usually unpleasing spatial qualities associated with basements, we took the project as an opportunity to explore relationships amongst multi-level family living. A split level design forms the basis of the added volume, introducing two extra levels in addition to the original ground floor level. A sunken living room with south-facing windows up to 4 meters high anchors the entire house and captures beautiful views from the Great Wall mountains in Northwestern Beijing. The new dining room, kept at original level, seamlessly connect the outdoor deck, sunken living room, and the original ground floor. The underground level is illuminated with ample natural light by a strip of horizontal windows to the south as well as indirect light from the living room above. The two added bedrooms and storage space allow the house a much more extended and flexible use as the family invites friends and greets grandchildren.
