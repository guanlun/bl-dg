This is a 53,000 square feet public library located in the heart of the historic French Quarter of New Orleans. A place for people to observe, read, and interact, the library is designed to form an open, liberating, and uplifting atmosphere in the middle of the constant huzzling and buzzling of the Quarter.<br /> <br />To achieve this, a giant canopy stands on 60-ft tall slim round stilts, hovering over the entire site. Its pattern is firstly informed by local oak tree branches and then optimized structurally and environmentally based on the material spanning property and shading demands. Any outdoor space below then becomes covered and shaded, the most desirable condition in a climate like New Orleans'. <br /><br />The four floors are articulated with a 2-foot gap to accentuate the image of floating. Penetrating the canopy, a 3-story tower sits on top of the main library. The tower provides 2 floors of reading space and a penthouse observation room that boasts panorama views of the Quarter and the entire city. It is accessible via a separate elevator 24/7.
