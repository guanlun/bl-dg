Percival Stern is home to the laboratory sciences at Tulane University in New Orleans. It was built in 1971 by Curtis and Davis and Thompson B. Burk and Associates. Students and faculty using the building nowadays often compalin about the fully enclosed hallways and the monotonous circulation and thus call for the reskinning  of its facade.<br /><br /> This proposal of the new facade focuses on the idea of logistics and connectivity. Pushing the existing dark hallways out to the perimeter of the building, the design brightens up the entire mass while enabling the facade to function as covered outdoor spaces. Further, the campus side of the hallways interweave to create a variety of circulation options, facilitate the flow of people and scientific items.
