This project seeks to expand the features and reorganize the program of this vacation house in order to facilitate the activities inside as well as fully utilize the natural scenery around the site.<br /><br /> In the exterior, the decorative porch and sloped roof were completely torn down to make way for a 10m-span observation deck and patio. This span was achieved with a steel box girder whose depth was minimized to 415mm. In the interior, the original staircase was removed and replaced by a spacious storage room on the first level and a new study on the second level. The new staircase relocated to the west side of the living room introduces a double height space that links the two floors together, providing connections that did not exist in the original design.
