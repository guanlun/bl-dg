The program of this one-week-long competition calls for a multi-purpose room to fit on the campus of Tulane University in New Orleans, LA.<br /><br /> The proposal features a sculptural triangle jutting out of the ground and reflecting its beautiful surroundings. The 'duck' invites visitors to descend underground - a kind of space that rarely exists in the area - to experience the 'decorated shed'.<br /><br /> It is in the  'shed' that one finds  a space that is both dark and bright, straight and curvy. Here, green roof, ceiling, ground, and landscape all become one integral piece that recaptures the spirit of minimalism.
