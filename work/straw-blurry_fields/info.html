Utilizing more than 17,000 straws, Jazzy Li and Eric Baumgartner led a team of 13 and strung together a blurry architectural space that engages touch, sound, and sight. Twelve panels form two constantly moving curtain walls and fluidity the space in between. The transparency and lightness of the installation allows itself to play with sun, wind, and light conditions. The ephemeral project does not take any static visual, acoustical, or sensual form. Instead, the dematerialization of straws, characterized by porosity and local interconnectivity, creates what Stan Allen calls - 'field conditions' - which are defined not by overarching geometrical schemas but by intricate intervals, repetitions, and seriality.
