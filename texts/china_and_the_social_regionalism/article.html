<p>ABSTRACT </p>

<p><b><i>This paper begins by giving an account of the last thirty years of China’s unprecedented transformations and credits the Western criticality that has one-directionally flowed into and influenced the theory and practice of contemporary Chinese architecture. In the meantime, the paper notes an increasing interest in attempting to understand the particular Chinese achievements and situations from the West. As we begin to see the West extracting critical points in China’s success, the paper argues that many of the Western readings are fragmented or biased judgments. By looking at works of contemporary Chinese architects, the paper proposes a social lens through which China’s architecture should be analyzed, understood, and further developed in the name of Social Regionalism. </i></b></p>

<p>Ever since the enactment of the Open and Reform policy put forward by Deng Xiaoping in 1978, the People’s Republic of China has experienced staggering <i>waves of rapid development in almost all sectors. Remaining politically socialist,</i> it gradually opened its doors and embraced the Western ideology, particularly that of a market economy. In hoping to <b>grasp the outside world and acquire</b> fresh knowledge, many college graduates flocked to western universities and schools; Meanwhile, foreign entrepreneurs flooded the newly established open market with direct investments, pouring in an unprecedented amount of human resources, technology, and capital. A previously introverted and locked ideology was exposed to the vast kaleidoscope of global cultures almost over night. From finance to real estate, from service to industry, and from music to art, there exists an overarching optimism in the mutually beneficial flow of goods and information between China and the West. In critical terms however, this flow followed a single-directional vector in that the underdeveloped China has always been learning from and catching up with the more advanced, civilized, and developed West but never the other way around. Dubbed as the ‘bringing-in-and-going-out’ policy, the government spared no efforts in enthusiastically inviting capitalist expertise and encouraging Chinese professionals to proactively learn from the West. </p>

<p>The vectorial tenet also held true for art and architecture in this period of China’s history. Foreign firms landed a considerable amount of projects in China as long as they partnered with a state-owned institute. Many competitions were held and sometimes commissions directly given in favor of the fame of a foreign name. By delivering a high level of excellence in large-scale, comprehensive, and technically sophisticated buildings, the foreign firms lend themselves to bridging the gap that exists in design methodologies, construction management, as well as detail specifications<href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref" title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a>. At the time, top Chinese architects and artists believed that Chinese ‘modernity’ is not a force from within but rather a process of ‘opening up’ to outside (mainly Western) influences.<href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref" title="">[2]</a> And the West would help address the country’s desperate need of ‘new ideas, examples of creativity, and artistic blood<href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref" title="">[3]</a>.’ It was exactly in this context that many collective projects, curated, funded, and supported by private sources, also sprung up all over the country. Commune by the Great Wall, ORDOS 100, Jinhua Architecture Park, Xixi Art Village, and many more attracted international attention by enlisting a ‘dream team’ of famed architects from around the world, Herzog &amp; de Meuron, Kengo Kuma, Steven Holl, just to name a few. Similar to the Weissenhofsledlung in scale and quality, these projects nevertheless lacked a collective manifesto from which theory specific to China could emerge.</p>

<p>Not only are contemporary practices of architecture in China influenced by their Western counterparts, the academia and the educational systems formulated under the legacies from the West as well. The School of Architecture at Tsinghua University, one of the best in China, was founded by the ‘Father of Modern Chinese Architecture’ Liang Sicheng, who studied at University of Pennsylvania. The two Schools of architecture remain in close ties until this day. Countless exchange programs, symposiums, visiting professorships were set up to promote the Western pedagogy. Preferring a Western education, many high school graduates have also opted for directly going to schools like the AA in the UK, SCI-Arc in the US, or ETH in Switzerland. </p>

<p>In addition, more than 30 years since China opened its doors, the first generation of western-educated Chinese architects have matured, reached their prolific ages, and started assuming leadership roles in shaping an emergent Chinese urbanity. Among them, people like Yung Ho Chang, Qingyun Ma, and Yansong Ma have set the precedent of operating with a great level of autonomy with their private offices rather than under the umbrella of state-owned design institutes. The autonomy gained in the privatizing of China’s architectural profession, not only facilitated free and personal expressions but also accelerated the ushering in of Western influences and theories to the country.</p>

<p>This single-directional import and internalization of Western architecture culminated in the run up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The largest works of Foster + Partners, Herzog &amp; de Meuron, and OMA/Rem Koolhaas were all coincidently completed within dozens of miles of each other in the same city. Exactly 30 years after the enactment of the Open and Reform policy, China was elevated to the world stage and poised to become the largest economy in this century<href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref" title="">[4]</a>. However, voices of criticism and concern could be heard both from abroad and at home. Domestically, nicknames with negative connotations were given to the high-profile projects: the Bird’s Nest (Beijing National Stadium), the Bird’s Egg (the National Center for the Performing Arts), and the Bird’s Legs (CCTV Headquarters). From professionals to average citizens, many criticized the lack of respect for context and wasteful use of materials, which led to hefty construction costs. Internationally, the masterminds behind these labor-intensive projects also faced serious charges for their contribution to the pervasive efforts in flashing up China’s image and their obedience to a totalitarian regime. ‘As a propaganda machine and an institute of censorship, the state television is the ultimate instrument of repression, and Koolhaas was going to provide it with an icon with which it could, brimming with confidence, present itself to the world.<href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref" title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a>’</p>

<p>It is just at this moment that, we began to see a shift of directionality in the flow of architectural theory and practice between China and the West, as observed by scholars and architects alike. In his essay ‘Criticality in between China and the West’, Jianfei Zhu notes that the West has enacted ‘a move from criticality to post-criticality by absorbing the vitality of production and pragmatism in the frontier of urbanization in China.<href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref" title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a>’ No longer is China simply a Western laboratory free to experiment, nor is it blindly importing what the West have to offer, its miraculous achievement (and pitfalls) are being studied and interpreted as lessons the West could learn from as well. </p>

<p>Scholars like George Baird and Michael Speaks have long expressed frustration over an architectural discourse plagued by criticality. Citing Koolhaas in his essay ‘Criticality and its Discontents,’ Baird promoted efficacy above criticality, social and practical understandings above formal and ideological positions<href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref" title="">[7]</a>. The slogan ‘Crossing the River by Touching the Stones’ coined by Deng Xiaoping in the early days of the Reform vividly captures this spirit of pragmatism in China that the West lacks today. In addition, comparing CCTV and Ground Zero, two competitions held roughly at the same time, Dutch Essayist Edzark Mik comments on the ‘empty rhetoric and bloodless commercialism’ that America has left to offer these days. China is the place where architects can afford the chance to serve the public good and provide a vision of the future.<href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref" title="">[8]</a> By exhibiting and building abroad, Chinese architects have also collectively initiated an era where their experiences and ideals offer significant relevance to global issues. In 2007, Beijing-based MAD Office headed by Yansong Ma became one of the first in China to win a major international competition. Their winning design for two residential towers named ‘Absolute World’ in Ontario, Canada is slated for completion this year. MAD Dinner, a monograph of the office’s work, was also published straight in English the following year. </p>

<p>Less than 4 years after the Olympics and 2 years the Shanghai EXPO, yet another extraordinary event marked a formal entrance of Chinese architecture to the international stage. In announcing Wang Shu and his Amerteur Architecture Studio as the 2012 Pritzker Architecture Prize recipient, Thomas J. Pritzker believes that the award ‘represents a significant step in acknowledging the role that China will play in the development of architectural ideals.’ Perhaps, Mr. Wang’s unexpected award can be directly comparable to US President Obama’s winning of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize. Rather than an acknowledgement of past works and efforts, it was more of the visions the figures respectively represent in architecture and world politics that lead to the bestowment of the awards for expected importance. President Obama interpreted the award as a call to action, and Wang Shu presumably too.</p>

<p>The China fever is unstoppable. </p>

<p>In the Great Leap Forward, Koolhass observes the efficiency of Chinese architects who are <i>‘designing five times the project volume in one-fifth the time, earning one-tenth the design fee’ with an implied ‘efficiency of 2500 times that of an American architect<href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref" title="">[9]</a></i>.” He also notes the ‘special intelligence and huge ingenuity created by straddling apparent contradictions’ among Chinese architects who have ‘learned so much from opposing world views’ in an extremely short period like no other. </p>

<p>Hans Ulrich Obrist documents the independence and autonomy of a new generation of Chinese architects and artists in his China interviews, often eliding his own presence to reveal the psychoanalytic underpinnings of this phenomenon<href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref" title="">[10]</a>. </p>

<p>Adrian Hornsby digs deep into the bones of Chinese politics in order to understand the inner workings of a totalitarian power.<href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref" title="">[11]</a> Niall Ferguson asks how China manages to live under a Communist system of government but with a thriving Capitalist economy in a recent documentary titled ‘China: Triump and Turmoil.’<href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref" title="">[12]</a></p>

<p>Conversely, the same generation of architects who first brought western influences back to China is now given opportunities to not only express their voices through lectures and teaching posts worldwide but also project the new China influence through leadership roles in several top architecture schools.</p>

<p>In 2005, MIT’s School of Architecture appoints Yung Ho Chang as Dean. Subsequently in 2007, the University of Southern California names Qingyun Ma as their Dean of the School of Architecture, all presumably in the hope that the raw energy from these most brilliant minds will trickle down the ranks to its own new stock of designers, according to Joseph Grima.<href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref" title="">[13]</a> Wang Shu participates 2010 Venice Biennale with the Tiled Garden project utilizing recycled materials and in the next year becomes the first Chinese architect to hold the Kenzo Tange Visiting Professorship at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design. Ai Weiwei, the paramount voice in contemporary Chinese art, although temporarily silenced under government investigation in 2011, exhibits in his absence the Sunflower Seeds installation at London’s Tate Modern Turbine Hall to critical acclaim, critiquing on the made-in-china phenomenon and causing widespread debates and discussions. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the capital city of China, Columbia University’s GSAPP sets up Studio-X Beijing to ‘think about the future in and with all the transformative regions of the world,’ according to Mark Wigley, Dean of the school. Robert Mangurian and Mary-ann Ray, both of whom are professors at SCI-Arc and the Taubman School of Architecture at University of Michigan establish B.A.S.E studios in Beijing to study the city’s urban and rural villages. </p>

<p>In response to the fast ascendency, some are exhilarated and some are concerned. But clearly the West is reacting with a sense of urgency to understand this vast Middle Kingdom that all seems too strange yet a bit familiar. Everyone from both inside and outside the country is trying to extract criticality from the overarching pragmatism that drives the development in both architectural theory and practice. </p>

<p>Doesn’t this all feel like a Déjà vu?</p>

<p>If we look at Japan half a century ago retrospectively, we see the flourishing of theories and practices that led to a unique Japanese modernity much admired and studied by the West. Influential Japanese architects in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Kunio Maekawa and subsequently Kenzo Tange both first studied and apprenticed under Le Corbusier and internalized the western modernist ideals to further develop their own brand of architectural theory, which was later titled Metabolism. Regarded as the last avant-garde architectural movement as well as the ‘last moment when architecture was a public rather than a private affair<href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref" title="">[14]</a>’, the Metabolism saw revitalized interests in contemporary studies following the rise of a digital paradigm in architecture and design. The following generation, characterized by minimalist practices like SANAA, strengthened the recognition and significance that Japanese architecture had already gained. It has become common practice for western architects to collaborate with their Japanese counterparts from whom they often draw inspirations and references. In publications like Learning From Japan by Florian Idenburg, this sense of a new architecture within a larger social context is becoming ever clearer<href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref" title="">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>However, situated in the middle of the ascendency of Chinese architecture, one cannot help but question what exactly China has to offer to the West in critical terms. Is it the shear efficiency that dwarfs Western developments and the totalitarian power regime that affords massive projects? Or is it the energy and optimism across the board that Chinese architects present to the world? Or rather is it the renaissance of Chinese traditions that possibly will shape up a new Asian aesthetic style? My view is that none of these constitutes the true lesson of China, for they are either fragmented readings or biased judgments formed form a purely Western standpoint. </p>

<p>As much as the efficiency of Chinese architects and the totalitarian decision making process can be viewed as a positive catalyst and an indispensable factor in China’s recent successful boom, the West has neglected the inconvenient costs that came with such an achievement, which has generated much criticism within the country. In lifting millions of people out of poverty and transforming insignificant towns into global metropolises, much of the countryside was not only left forgotten but in many cases devastated by the invasion of buildings, factories, and an erosive profit-driven mentality. In some cases villages were wiped out to make way for real-estate developments without a collective consent; in other, they were stranded in the waves of urbanization and became a marginalized voice-in-refusal to the growing gap between the new and the old, the urban and the rural, the rich and the poor. Such damages have amounted immense pressure and led to a foreseeable danger of social unrest so prominent that the Communist Party had to address with a set of policies under the name of ‘Socialist New Village.’</p>

<p>It would also be naïve for the West to be envious of the opportunities and flourishing energy currently available in China, as the nation is well on its way to a become a developed state. Sooner or later, the miraculous economic growth dependent solely on foreign exports and massive construction is going to slow down and eventually come to an end. It is inevitable by mid-21<sup>st</sup> century that China will face the same critical issues of a developed society. A transition from an extensive economic growth model to an intensive one has been called for. It is only a matter of time that the disciplines of art, design, and architecture would take similar actions against this fast-tracked, thought-lacking, and profit-based process.</p>

<p>There have always been a substantial amount of keen interests in traditional Chinese art and architecture. Delicate vases and chinas can often be seen among the premiere collections of Western museums and art connoisseurs. The Forbidden City in the North and Suzhou Gardens in the South continue to be top tourist attractions as well as academic subjects of scholarly studies. Old paintings and calligraphy that date back to several hundred years are being auctioned off at sky-high prices. With contemporary home-educated architects like Wang Shu, Liu Jiakun and artistis like Ai Weiwei who are very much concerned with the restoring and renewing of such traditional poetics in their work, it is natural that the West already has started to speculate the arrival of a Chinese modernity. ‘It’s interesting that there’s been this idea of a universal modernity,’ noted Hans Obrist, ‘But in reality multiple modernities have made it passé. So there’s a Brazilian modernity, there is a Singaporean modernity, there is a Chinese modernity.<href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref" title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a>’ As valid and positive such an observation sounds, it remains a very fragmented and limited reading. Based on geo-cultural conditions specific to China, this view can be compared to that of Critical Regionalism, which celebrates an aesthetic, tectonic, and perhaps stylistic engagement with art and architecture<href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref" title="">[17]</a>but falls short when studied and compared to past movements like the Modernist for universal significance on the discourse and theory.</p>

<p>Critical regionalism is a theory that has generated lots of interests and debates in the past. Around the globe, works of James Stirling, Alvar Alto, Frank Llyod Wright, Peter Zumthor, and others all exemplified qualities of critical regionalism that respond to local colors, materials, and customs and embrace and transform traditions.<href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref" title="">[18]</a> Most recently, the work of the 2012 Pritzker Laureate Wang Shu is also being read as a Chinese manifestation of critical regionalism by the same token as the ‘Ten Points’ laid out by Kenneth Frampton: ‘It would be wed to its setting, in either rural or urban landscape; it would foster craft and push the limits of technology; it would speak to the individual and search for the universal; exalt the craft of building while at the same time encourage a new consciousness in the manufacture of machine products.’ </p>

<p>However, as Yung Hong Chang has pointed out in his interview with Hans Obrist, China is currently experiencing highly uncertain times and cultural transitions, which have enabled architects to ‘build and serve society through design,’ an agenda Chang believes that ‘the West has struggled to establish’ with architecture<href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref" title="">[19]</a>. Thousands of people flock to urban areas along the coast every day only to find them without a basic habitat. Municipal governments are move into new office headquarters flanked by gigantic monuments and open public plazas too expansive and daunting for peasant-turned-city habitants to occupy; Multi-billion-yuan face-lifting projects by high profile international architects only worsen the popular view that architecture is a beauty contest belonged to the rich and possesses no relevance to the ordinary life of an average citizen.</p>

<p>In this ongoing exchange of critical ideals and practices between China and the West, what I believe China is poised to offer, through architecture and the activity of building, is a regionalism that is reloaded with humanistic concerns and charged with social ambitions, one that marries the specific social ambitions with design potentials. Such a Social Regionalism, in my view, would prompt architectural practices with deep political engagements and amplifying public effects previously unimaginable. </p>

<p>The Social Regionalism needs to answer the call for quality habitats for the vast population of China’s working class, those who could not afford houses, apartments, workplaces, or other spaces in the open market and precisely those who bear a dismissive and biased view on the role of architecture. </p>

<p>The Tulou Project by Urbanas can be read as an experiment in this regard. Informed by the Hakkah Houses, a residential typology that date back to 300 years ago and can be found in some southern provinces in China, Urbanus reinterpreted its circular form and collective nature and transformed it into 245 affordable housing units for low-income families. Rather than simply replicating the original layout of Hakkah Houses, Urbanus studied and experimented with internal partitions to achieve the balance between senses of individual privacy and collective life. Sited in an urban area, a series of considerations were also taken into account for the building to be stitched within the existing city fabric consisting of green areas, overpasses, highways, and residual lands. In rural areas, there have also been significant projects that exemplify the idea of a socially charged critical regionalism. The Bridge School by Li Xiaodong Atelier is a very small building that simultaneously offers four seemingly conflicting programs – education space for an elementary school, a bridge connecting two old castles across the creek, a playground for the students, and a stage for the residents of this remote village in Fujian Province. The project injects a new spirit into the village, for it not only reactivates the two traditional castles with contemporary functions, but also enables educational activities to be carried out without interruption. Inside the bridge school, students absorb knowledge of all sorts whereas outside, it posits itself as a legacy of the past connecting the present with the future.</p>

<p>In realizing such humble projects, both Urbanus and Li Xiaodong Atelier achieve not only required functions but also a social agenda specific to the region. Although the agendas in these two projects remain distinct, they inform an architecture that carries a social stamp of universality. Occupants of the projects benefit from the programmatic spaces that meet their urgent needs but more importantly gain tangible understanding and appreciation through the everyday experience of critical architecture. The educational role such Social Regionalism architecture could play has the potential to influence governments, developers, and other potential occupants alike. By raising such awareness that architects once again could serve the public good and bear social responsibility through their design, we will be fostering a unique environment from which more works in this spirit could emerge and the systematic theorization of Social Regionalism could commence. </p>

<p>It is only in this context that China will pull together all the other previously discussed advantages to truly set an example of the urbanization of a developing world. Not a prediction in itself, this statement is to call for a Social Regionalism that imminently re-enacts an era where architecture is a series of publicly participatory acts rather than stationary objects or bloodless images.</p>
