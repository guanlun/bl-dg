<p>Ever since human beings came about on planet earth, men have been building shelters that provide places for rest, work, and leisure. It did not take too long for this activity to evolve into a well-established profession known as architecture today. Over the course of this rich and prolonged history however, the relationship between a piece of architecture and its creator has varied dramatically. There are works that explicitly express distinctive characters given by its architects, and there are also works that appear monochromatic, generic, and detached from the design intentions of the architect, if there are any. Such seemingly random variations among existing works of architecture are certainly not without an underlying pattern upon analytical scrutiny. By acknowledging the pattern, one not only gains a better insight into architectural history and theory, but also begins to intelligently speculate about the future trajectory of this profession. </p>

<p>The practice of drafted architectural designs serving as guidance and legal reference for the physical construction stages of a project might seem like a mundane standard today, but the fact is that buildings were erected without such ink-on-paper guidance for the most part of our history. Adapting to varied needs and climates, regional solutions evolving from the ¡®primitive hut¡¯ quickly formed a series of vernacular prototypes, such as the basic rammed-earth houses in Egypt and the elevated bamboo habitats in Southeast Asia. Rather than architects, skilled artisans such as bricklayers and masons dominated the creation of architecture based on such phenomenological prototypes for many centuries. Even the ¡®master builders¡¯ who created wonders like the Pantheon approached their work with a trial-and-error attitude. Drawing techniques simply had not been developed enough to help envision new forms or solve complex joints and details. When such tasks came about, often times the builders had to be on site directly measuring, testing, and figuring out the next step based on what is already there. A famous example is the dome in Florence built by Filippo Brunelleschi, which was completed in 1436. With a dome at an unimaginable scale, the project presented itself as the most challenging problem in construction at the time, so challenging that even the original planners believed that it would not be possible without a divinely talented master sent by God<href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref" title="">[1]</a>. Brunelleschi proved to be such a master who successfully erected the dome by inventing a new hoist that could lift all the bricks (totaling more than 4 million) for the dome and held them in place while the mortar dried. Despite the lack of drawings and specific instructions, Brunelleschi was the one and only who knew exactly how to put the dome together as he embraced all the little challenges along the way. Although he had many bricklayers constructing the dome for him, it was his personal directions that they followed, which turned such a feat into reality. A true master builder, Brunelleschi maintained absolute control over the design and construction of the dome by providing a genius solution that nobody else could have imagined. The dome eternally exists like a unique signature of Brunelleschi¡¯s, carrying his characteristics whilst symbolizing the epitome of an autographic relationship between a master builder and his work.</p>

<p>However, a contemporary of Brunelleschi in the 15<sup>th</sup> century reinvented this long-standing model of the autograph with a revolutionary discovery ¨C the graphical perspective representing the effects of human vision in planar paintings. Leon Battista Alberti, an Italian who had a substantial knowledge of optics, not only understood the principles of perspectives but also formulated a theory of planar projections, which allowed him to accurately represent spatial qualities in painting. Before long, Alberti began to make perspective paintings of the city he saw and soon discovered the underlying implications of perspectives, a powerful tool still widely in use today that serves as the foundation of visual representation. If a three-dimensional building can be envisaged and accurately represented on two-dimensional planes prior to construction, then the architect would not only be able to foresee possible design flaws and conflicts, but also be freed from the autographic relationship. This unprecedented freedom allowed architects to efficiently plan a project in advance and simultaneously work on multiple projects. Alberti indeed went on to design buildings such as the Palazzo Rucellai with this new approach. He even once ¡®famously advised architects against directing the actual construction: in his view, building should be left to the workers and their supervisors.<href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref" title="">[2]</a>¡¯ In contrast to the autographic tradition before him, Alberti created and added the process of design drafting between the conception of ideas and the erection of buildings and deliberately distanced him away from the role of a builder. He became the first and foremost <b>architect </b>in its modern sense. His pursuits kick started a shift from an autographic paradigm to one that is allographic.</p>

<p>Fully embracing the newly discovered techniques of perspectives, this representational tool expedited the adoption of the allographic approach by architects of the following centuries. In addition to perspectives, the concepts of plans, sections, elevations, and axonometric drawings were standardized to allow a clear and universal communication between all parties involved. A division between architects who design and craftsmen who build was gradually forming as such a belief became a principle ¨C anything that could be realized can be drawn, and thus anything that cannot be drawn could not be realized. There certainly is a degree of truism in following this principle, but at the price of its intrinsic constraints and limitations. For instance, architects favored straightforward grids over irregular formations and planar surfaces over doubly ruled surfaces because the latter presented too big a challenge in the matter of representation. Opportunities outside the box were often dismissed for exactly this reason. On the other hand, as architects became more in charge of the general design and less concerned about the construction process, specialists such as engineers and contractors emerged as new professions and industries that are integral to the execution of a project. It was in 1759 that the world¡¯s first self-proclaimed civil engineer, John Smeaton, successfully helped construct the Eddystone Lighthouse<href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref" title="">[3]</a>. Going above and beyond the obligation to build per architect¡¯s instructions, engineers and contractors often consulted and challenged the design and gradually gained a degree of control to reinterpret the original plan. The unique signature of an architect explicitly evident in the autographic relationship chipped away as the allographic model divided up the authority among many parties involved.</p>

<p>In the late 19<sup>th</sup> century that saw the industrial revolution and ushered in the Machine Age, the limiting aspects of the allographic modus operandi became even more obvious. On one hand, the Machine enabled the mass production of a variety of goods, which greatly enhanced the living standards and the overall efficiency of society; on the other hand, with mass production also came mass standardization and specialty. While architects enjoyed the ability to create new designs based on industrially produced identical parts, much compromise had to be made for the limitation of both the machines and the representation techniques. Engineers, mechanics, and contractors began to play an increasingly defining role in shaping the design. William Morris, the artist and writer who instigated the influential Arts and Crafts Movement in England, adamantly opposed to using the Machine in the creation of art and architecture. In making his highly decorative tapestry designs, Morris believed in the hand-made and mostly operated autographically by introducing genuineness and unique signature to his work. Despite the fact that Morris later admitted that we must ¡®master our machines¡­ as an instrument for forcing better conditions of life<href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref" title="">[4]</a>,¡¯ he saw the danger of the allograph, in which artists and architects subconsciously surrender their control and intentions to the conventions and limitations. With the success of projects such as the Crystal Palace by Joseph Paxton, it was clear that with advancements in representation made firstly in the 15<sup>th</sup> Century and the advancements in fabrication made in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, the entire architectural profession was marching full speed towards the allographic model. Reverting back to the autograph was hardly an option.</p>

<p>Even still, it is worth pointing out that the development of any history is never linear: against the mainstream tides there always exist a few rebellious talents. Antonio Gaudi (1852-1926), the well-known architect for works such as the Sagrada Familia, was one such talent against the shift to the allograph. Although known as the figurehead of Catalan Modernism and being contemporaries of other Modernist pioneers such as Peter Behrens (1868-1940, notable for the AEG Turbine Factory completed in 1909), Gaudi¡¯s work not only struck the public as visually distinctive but also left architectural critics and art historians a vast treasure based on which issues of the different approaches to Modern Architecture could be speculated. In Gaudi¡¯s Sagrada Familia, not only did he maximize the use of physical models to mock up parts of his design to a degree where a plaster workshop was established on site, he also built a school right next to the Church for the children of the workers so that together with himself they could devote all of their best efforts to create this ¡®Gesamtkunstwerk.¡¯ Constantly seeking inspiration from Mother Nature, Gaudi realized that conventional drawing techniques could not accurately represent forms such as the one-leaf hyperboloid or the hyperbolic paraboloid, nor could they do them justice in illustrating their potentials in creating unexpected spaces and nuanced lighting conditions. No one before Gaudi had ever attempted anything like this in construction, and it was this very fact that made him feel that ¡®convinced as I am of the perfection they represent, it is my duty to apply them.<href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref" title="">[5]</a>¡¯ He resorted to the old fashioned way of craftsmanship and of hand making. In creating designs such as the eight-pointed star-shaped column growing with a two-way helicoid, he hand made a series of large scale models, the final version of which would then be enlarged and built for the Church by workers who directly observed the three dimensional object rather than a set of drawings. In doing so, Gaudi achieved a high level of control and distinction in his design similar to Brunelleschi with his dome in Florence. </p>

<p>However, Gaudi¡¯s approach celebrating the spirit of the autograph remained mostly local and ephemeral, whereas the mainstream Modernist movement favored the allographic way of working, leaving a lasting negative impact to the profession until this day. Indeed the danger that architects could be sidelined grew only bigger as we turn to more contemporary practices. The post-war boom in new construction facilitated a clearer than ever division in the industry. Regarded as a service-providing profession by most, architects became obligated to mediate all the interests from not only the client/owner, the contractor/fabricator, but also a growing number of consultants, such as engineers, managers, coordinators, and surveyors. Moreover, limitations imposed upon architects by budgets, zoning laws, and other professional regulations further deprived architects of creative space to an extent that architects are described to be those who are only left to design the 10¡± skin, for the rest of a building is all predetermined. Although it is true that an architectural project often entails a large group of collaborators working closely together, such collaboration also posts an alarming threat that if pushed to an extreme, the allographic model may eventually render architects unnecessary.</p>

<p>The gloomy outlook took almost a 180-degree turn when the Information Age struck our civilization like a whirlwind. With the invention of the computer in the 1960s and the introduction of graphical interfaces and applications in the 1980s, Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD and CAM) technologies soon caught the attention of architectural profession. Whilst the industry saw such new developments in representation tools as a great way to catalogue, store, and transfer conventional design documents and information (indeed the early versions of AutoCAD only had commands such as line, hatch, rectangle, etc merely mimicking a hand-drawing experience in a digital environment), pioneers such as Greg Lynn unleashed a much bigger potential with explorations in three-dimensional real-time modeling on the computer. What uniquely existed in these three-dimensional digital environments was the ability to accurately represent free-form 3D geometry based on mathematical methods such as NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines). It became incredibly easy not only to model complex forms in 3D, but also create unfamiliar surfaces and volumes through unique operations that had yet to exist in reality. This completely broke the well-established principle that ¡®anything that cannot be drawn could not be realized.¡¯ Such a revelation trigged much passion and interests into this newfound territory, where architects such as Frank Gehry (The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain) and Peter Cook (Kunsthaus Graz in Austria) created works that were characterized by their complex and curvaceous forms and would later be dubbed as ¡®blobs.¡¯ Unlike the advancement in representational tools in the 15<sup>th</sup> century, this time the digital 3D environment triggered the revival of an architect-driven practice and hinted a sense of optimism that the loss of control and design intentions through the allographic transformation could be somehow reclaimed.</p>

<p>This is indeed what is happening. Following the popularization of CAD technologies, architecture as an industry digitally evolved further by learning from other industries such as shipbuilding and airplane manufacturing, both of which had been much more advanced in turning the computer aided designs into reality with a variety of fabrication processes. Laser cutting, 3D printing, CNC milling, and most recently robotic operations are among a few most notable and applied examples that enabled a direct process known as ¡®file to factory.¡¯ Installations such as the P-Wall by Andrew Kudless / Matsys<href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref" title="">[6]</a> explored such techniques and demonstrated the possibility that architects¡¯ design intentions can be firmly upheld throughout the construction process<href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref" title="">[7]</a>, implying that the added process of drafting in the allographic approach could be completely eliminated. Almost six centuries after the discovery of perspectives, this heralded a return to the autographic relationship: architects could finally be in control! Criticism against such a stance quickly emerged as people argued that such developments in fabrication for architectural use are extremely limiting due to the small scale that most of the CNC technologies could yet to accommodate. Many other small-scale installations, pavilions, and experiments like the P-wall, were cited as evidence for such arguments. People from the construction industry particularly restated the necessity in the conventional methods of building where human labor is utilized and the allographic relationship is customarily practiced. </p>

<p>However, as more firms like SHoP Architects are breaking up with this traditional model, it appears that there is no stopping in the reclaiming of architects¡¯ controlled territory and the returning of the autographic relationship. Based in New York City, SHoP Architects is a practice that positions itself at the forefront of digital innovations. As opposed to flamboyantly using the technology to create flashy forms, SHoP¡¯s approach is one that more seeks to expand their role beyond merely that of a design architect. They operate as a hybrid body of architects, fabricators, contractors, software engineers, and even developers. Project of theirs such as the completed apartment building at 290 Mulberry Street in New York and the Atlantic Yards basketball arena currently under construction clearly demonstrate how they managed to retain 100% control from design to completion by using digital representation and fabrication technologies and giving step-by-step instructions to conventional trade specialists. What SHoPs is now able to do is not only modeling the final result of their design in a 3D environment but also the entire construction process including the scaffolding and movements of the crane. Similarly, practices such as 1:One Computational Geometry run by Benjamin Koren have also been able to tap into the reclaimed territory through the form of consultancy, indirectly giving the design control back to architects. Collaborating with Herzog &amp; de Meuron on the Elbphilharmonie Hamburg project in Germany, 1:One deployed and generated a custom, non-standard, and CNC fabricated sound diffusive surface geometry for both the symphonic hall and the chamber music hall (totaling 6,800 m<sup>2</sup>), achieving an unprecedented reverberation time and thus greatly enhancing the acoustical performance of the space. It is clear to see that the employment of these existing and emerging digital technologies at increasingly larger scales and wider ranges has shaken the allographic practice and set the autographic model as the main theme of architecture in the early decades of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The power of the identical copy introduced by the Machine Age is being replaced by the power of mass customization enabled by the Digital Age.</p>

<p>In retrospect, an oscillating pattern (see diagram below) between the autographic and allogrpahic models can be clearly observed. The autographic dominated until the 15<sup>th</sup> century but the allographic soon prevailed for a couple of centuries as techniques of representation (discovery of perspectives) and fabrication (invention of machines) matured and perfected. From having total control of the entire design-to-build process, architects stood at the verge of being kicked out of the practice. The invention of digital techniques in representation and fabrication however struck as a game changer and reverted the track back to the origin ¨C autographic and in control. But are we going actually going back to the origin in a regressive way? </p>

<p>Perhaps not. Just like the general history of human civilization, we advance in a manner that sometimes seems indecisive and regressive. Rather than a linear trajector, our evolution often falls in a path of a ascending spiral. Same holds true for the oscillation between the two modesl. Keeping this trajectory in mind, it is now easy to explain the past and the future: Starting from autographic, we progressed towards the allographic, a process empowered by firstly the advancement in representational tools and then fabrication techniques. Similarly, we are now on our way back to the autograph since the representation and fabrication techniques saw dramatic developments over the last 30 years. Following this trajectory, we now dare to look at what is in store for architecture further up along the ascending spiral. Suppose architects reclaim full autographic control in the near future, what does it mean to revert back to the allographic model from that point? Perhaps I may suggest, as already shown in projects by Gramazio &amp; Kohler, video and dynamics stimulations (advancement in representation) and robotic manufacturing (advancement in fabrication) will be able to create self-organizing systems characterized by interactivity, user participation, and a bottom-up approach. Architects voluntarily distance themselves from the project: rather than create beautiful end states, they set up only the initial state of rule-based systems from which adaptive and responsive architecture can emerge and change over time. It is the robots and the occupants that allographically determine the architecture. To boldly expand the imagination even further, what would it mean to ascend the spiral from that point onto another autographic model? Perhaps, one of many possibilities could be a highly networked architectural existence where architects¡¯ control and design intentions are expressed not by the constantly flexing appearances and spatial conditions but through the interdependent performative evaluation based on which balanced design input is weighted and executed throughout the network.</p>

<p>Oscillating between the two models, architecture is destined to continue evolving alongside the entire human civilization. It is exciting to be able to see through history and understand our current positions with well-calculated patterns. It is equally exciting also to not be able to see too distant a future that the pattern is unable to predict given too many undetermined factors. We shall have high expectations of architecture, and of the entire human race.</p>
